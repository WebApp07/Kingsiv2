          <h1>Ensuring a Dependable Response for Emergencies</h1>
          <h3>
            Elevator malfunctions are practically unavoidable, given there are
            approximately 20 billion annual elevator trips in the United States
            alone. Often, these malfunctions result from simple wear and tear
            while other times they stem from errors in the elevator’s internal
            diagnostic system which require the assistance of a professional
            technician. Regardless of the underlying cause, being trapped in an
            elevator is a harrowing and unsettling experience, sometimes even
            posing safety risks and potential health concerns.
